## Key Components

- `bin/www`: This is the entry point of the application. This is where the server is created and started. This file is usually used to set up the server and listen to a specific port.
- `config/`: This folder contains configuration files and environment variables. The `index.js` file is the centralized configuration entry point.
- `public/`: This folder contains static files such as images, stylesheets, and scripts.
- `routes/`: This folder contains route definitions. The `index.js` file contains the default routes, and other route modules can be added as needed (e.g., `users.js`).
- `models/`: This folder contains database models. Each model represents a collection in the database (e.g., `user.js`).
- `views/`: This folder contains template files. These files are used to render dynamic content on the server-side.
- `controllers/`: This folder contains controller files that separate the logic from the routes. Each controller file contains logic related to a specific route or resource.
- `middlewares/`: This folder contains custom middleware files. Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (`req`), the response object (`res`), and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle.
- `utils/`: This folder contains utility and helper functions. These functions are used to perform common tasks that are not directly related to the main application logic.
- `tests/`: This folder contains test files. Tests can be organized into integration tests and unit tests.
- `.env`: This file contains environment variables. Environment variables are used to store sensitive information or configuration settings that should not be hard-coded in the application.
- `app.js`: This is the main application file where you set up middlewares, routes, and other configurations.
- `package.json`: This file contains project metadata and dependencies. It also includes scripts that can be used to run various tasks such as starting the server or running tests.
- `README.md`: This file contains an overview of the project and documentation.
- `package-lock.json`: This file is automatically generated by npm and stores an exact, versioned dependency tree.
